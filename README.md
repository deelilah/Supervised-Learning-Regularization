# Supervised-Learning-Regularization
1.0 Problem Statement
As a Data Scientist, you work for Hass Consulting Company which is a real estate leader with over 25 years of experience.I have been tasked to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months.

Later onwards, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.

1.1 Metrics Of Success
The main purpose is to use the factors provided in the dataset to be able to create a model that can predict the prices of the houses.

1.2 Understanding the context
Through external reading we get to see that housing is a crucial part of the country and individual asset which brings income to a country and an individual.

Unemployment hovering at a 50-year low and interest rates well below historical norms, the real estate industry is being dragged down by scarcity in housing stock, especially at lower price ranges, Not enough homes are being built, and homeowners are staying put longer, creating a bottleneck.

1.3 Record and Experimental Design
Read and explore the given dataset.

Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.

Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording your observations.

Performing regression analysis.

Incorporate categorical independent variables into your models.

Check for multicollinearity.

Provide a recommendation based on your analysis.

Create residual plots for your models, and assess heteroskedasticity using Barlett's test.
